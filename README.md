#### Product Definition Statement

The Pediatric Wheel (Pedi-Wheel) is a web application for Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT's) and Paramedics used as a memory jog in emergency situations involving pediatric patients. Since pediatrics are not common patients, pediatric-specific information may not be as easily recalled as adult-specific patient information. The purpose of the application is to provide EMS personnel with a quick reference to critical, relevant information quickly and easily.

A physical Pediatric Wheel exists, but is large and may not be as readily available as a cellular telephone (iPhone) would be. Also the information from the physical Pediatric Wheel is often outdated and requires the purchase of the current product. [Here is the actual Pediatric Wheel in action](https://vimeo.com/8114904).

#### User Case Scenarios

Kyra is a seasoned paramedic for a local ambulance company. Despite her experience, critical pediatric patients still make her nervous. Because of this, and because she doesn't get dispatched to many of those types of calls, she wants to be on top of her game. Now that she has the Pediatric Wheel application on her iPhone, she can obtain the weight of the child from the parents, refer to the application, and get the appropriate weight-based advanced life support information quickly and without second-guessing herself. This translates into more efficient care for the sick child and praise from her employer for the donation that company recieved from the child's grateful parents.

Matt is a brand new paramedic, fresh out of Corning Community College. He doesn't like pediatric calls because "kids are much more than just small adults." Since he is still familiarizing himself with the field, he is not sure which laryngoscope blade or endotracheal tube would be best suited for which size child or what pulse rate range he should not be concerned about for a 6-month old. Using his Pediatric Wheel application on his iPod Touch, he can provide efficient, quality care in the backcountry woods of Steuben County without cell service, despite still being really nervous.
